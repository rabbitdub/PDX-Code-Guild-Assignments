    <p>John Mayer was born October 16, 1977 in Fairfield County, Connecticut.</p>
    <p>Mayer attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but left and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook.
        Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters.
        After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following.
        After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and eventually to
        Columbia Records, which released his first extended play Inside Wants Out.
        His following two studio albums—Room for Squares (2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—performed well commercially,
        achieving multi-platinum status.
        In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
    </p>
    <p>By 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing
        the blues and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician.
        He collaborated with blues artists such as B. B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio,
        he released a live album, Try!, in 2005 and his third studio album Continuum in 2006.
        Both albums received positive reviews, and Continuum earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.
        He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Waiting on the World to Change".
        That album was followed by Battle Studies in 2009, a return to pop, with a Battle Studies World Tour.</p>
    <p>After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began
        work on his fifth studio album, Born and Raised, which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel
        Canyon.
        However, the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and
        forced him to cancel the planned tour.
        The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous
        work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album,
        Paradise Valley, which incorporates country music influences.
        By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.[3] His seventh album, The Search for
        Everything, a loose concept album based around the theme of a romantic break-up, was released in 2017.
        Mayer released his latest album Sob Rock, inspired by 1980s soft rock music, in July 2021. </p>
